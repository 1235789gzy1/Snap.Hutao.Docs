## <HopeIcon icon="iconfont icon-expansion" size="1.7rem" color="rgb(7, 163, 161)" /> Install Optional Components

With optional components, Snap Hutao can implement some functions more conveniently through the system-level environment.
They are not mandatory components, but they can bring a better experience.

### <img src="/images/202312/MSEdge.webp" width="20" height="20"> WebView2 Runtime

WebView2 Runtime is provided by Microsoft, which enables a built-in browser at a low resource cost inside the program.
As an optional component, WebView2 is not a mandatory component, but it will make some Snap Hutao's features easier.

At the bottom of the [Microsoft official page](https://developer.microsoft.com/zh-cn/microsoft-edge/webview2/),
you can find`Evergreen Standalone Installer`, choose`x64`download and install as prompted

## <HopeIcon icon="iconfont icon-adduser" size="1.7rem" color="rgb(7, 163, 161)" /> Add First MiHoYo BBS Account

After entering Snap Hutao, click `Account Panel` in the left-bottom corner between `Settings` and `Document`. In the
pop-up panel, click the login button right corresponding to your account.

If you are using a China server account, you need login within `MiYouShe` category; If you are using an oversea account
(aka. HoYoLAB/HoYoverse account), you need login within `HoYoLAB` category.

Whatever account type you have, you have both `Web Login` and `Cookie Login` method.
