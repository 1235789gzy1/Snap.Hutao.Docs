- When Snap Hutao shows the following warning, it means the action is blocked by MiHoYo BBS anti-bot verification system
  - `Verification failed. Please check MiHoYo BBS - My Character - DailyNote manually`
  - `Imperceptible verification failed`

- Solution
  - Solution 1 <Badge text="Recommended" type="tip" /> ：
    - Use `Refresh Cookie` function in the account panel
  - Solution 2：
    - Open MiHoYo BBS mobile application
    - Click `Me`, find personal profile page
    - Click `My Characters`
      - Click `All Characters` or `Real-time notes` window
    - You may need to manually finish the verification process 
      - Process the steps until you are required to verify account
      - If you cannot trigger the verification process, you can change the password

::: tip

If the risk prompt is too frequent, or the verification cannot be triggered at all, it means that the risk of your 
account is too high, please change the password, so that the simultaneous login status of multiple devices will be reset

::: warning

- You hardly cannot pass imperceptible verification when your account is **login at other remote Genshin tools** or 
**login at multiple devices**. This is a security designing of MiHoYo BBS, and cannot bypass
- If you are using **multiple MiHoYo BBS account in your device**, **frequent usage with MiHoYo BBS API** will 
result in your IP address being banned for a period of time (usually no more than 24 hours). This is a security 
designing of MiHoYo BBS, and cannot bypass
