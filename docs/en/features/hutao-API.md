# Hutao Database / Abyss Record

Snap Hutao offers two major statistic features associated with Spiral Abyss challenge
- `Abyss Stats` on the sidebar is a feature designed to help players who are not familiar with Genshin Impact's 
battle system to build teams, pass the Abyss and obtain rewards by collecting and displaying challenge stats data from 
the Spiral Abyss from a large number of players.
- `Abyss Record` on the sidebar is a statistical feature that helps individuals review their gaming experience and 
personal data collection by saving their challenge data from each period of the Spiral Abyss.
  - Many players contribute to the Hutao Database's `Abyss Stats` dataset by uploading their personal `Abyss Records`
